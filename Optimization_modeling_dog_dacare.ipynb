    "Our objective is to maximize the daily profit. We formulated our objective function by adding up the profits made by big dogs and small dogs and deducting fixed costs from it. The profits from big dogs are calculated by taking the difference of the revenues and variable costs from big dogs (\\\\$43-\\\\$5 = \\\\$38) and the same fashion applies for the calculation of small dogs (\\\\$28-\\\\$3=\\\\$25). The variable costs are mainly from dog food and different dog supplies such as toy for them to play with. The monthly fixed costs are calculated by summing up the rent & utility costs, insurance, labor and license costs. In order to obtain the daily fixed costs, we divide the monthly fixed costs by 30 days. Therefore, our objective function is:\n",

So, when increasing the size by 1 square feet, profit only increases by \\\\$ 0.30. Given the rent in Vancouver, this is economically inefficient. The other constraint is the number of employees. According to the sensitivity analysis, we recommend PUPTOWN GIRLS to hire additional employees to achieve higher profits.
